Examples of modules:
 - Basic hab  
 - Power: Solar, fission, fusion  
 - Batteries  
 - Water tanks  
 - Storage  
 - Dormitory  
 - Hydroponics  
 - Kitchen  
 - Engineering, fabrication  
 - Smelting  
 - Air processing  
 - Engines  
 - Armour  
 - Weapons  
 - Comms  
 - Mining  
 - Access tube  
 - Waste processing?

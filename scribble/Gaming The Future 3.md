For those interested in digging a little deeper into the Dune games, following [my new 'Gaming the Future' article](http://www.starshipsofa.com/2012/11/06/starshipsofa-no-263-pamela-sargent/), I recommend:

1.  [Checking out the soundtrack of Dune 1 on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjHon6yg-r8&feature=related).
2.  [Take a look at the list of Dune games on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dune_games).
3.  [Checking out the original film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/).

For those interested in more information about the Homeworld games, I'd recommend the following links:

-   [Watch the cinematics on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW4jkQdmjI) - they're lovely, and give you a good background for the game.
-   [Relic's download page for Homeworld-related stuff](http://www.relicnews.com/homeworld/hw-downloads/) - demos, patches, desktop themes - even the source code of the game, and a unit viewer.

Hope you enjoyed my article, and I'll see you in a month, with my next topic: Frank Herbert's Dune.

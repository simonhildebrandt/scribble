For those interested in more information about the Homeworld games, I'd recommend the following links:

-   [Watch the cinematics on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW4jkQdmjI) - they're lovely, and give you a good background for the game.
-   [Relic's download page for Homeworld-related stuff](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.relicnews.com%2Fhomeworld%2Fhw-downloads%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3N8_snv6K_IvB0Qh7X8Q3A) - demos, patches, desktop themes - even the source code of the game, and a unit viewer.

Hope you enjoyed my article, and I'll see you in a month, with my next topic: Frank Herbert's Dune.

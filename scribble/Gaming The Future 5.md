For those interested in [my latest column on Starship Sofa](http://www.starshipsofa.com/2013/02/13/starshipsofa-no-276-ken-liu/) about the game Another World, here's a few quick links to help out:

-   More info on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)),
-   buy the game at [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/gamecard/another_world_15th_anniversary_edition), or
-   buy it on the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotemu.anotherworld&hl=en).

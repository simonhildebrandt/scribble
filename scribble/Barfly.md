Barfly is a crowd-sourced database of product information, based primarily on barcodes.

The intention is to provide a standard web widget that can use an available camera to scan barcodes and look them up in the database, giving [[Login With Link|authenticated users]] the ability to contribute detailed information about the products, that can then be validated for correctness and shared through the API - perfect as a way to identify products in [[RunTo.Store|]].

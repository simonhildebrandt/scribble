I've loved stories read aloud ever since my parents read to me as a child. So when I discovered podcasting and fiction narration, I knew I had to give it a try.

# Hosting

I took over hosting duties for the (now mothballed) [Protecting Project Pulp podcast](http://ppp.requisite.link), where assistant editor Fred Himebaugh, sound engineer Tom O'Dwyer, producer Tony Smith and myself brought a new classic pulp-era story to the airwaves every week.

# Narrating

So far I've read stories for the following District of Wonders podcasts - [Starship Sofa](http://www.starshipsofa.com/), [Tales to Terrify](http://talestoterrify.com/) and [Protecting Project Pulp](http://protectingprojectpulp.com/) - and Amanda McCall's romance podcast, [RomPod](http://rompod.com/) (now defunct). I'm hoping to contribute to [Librivox](http://librivox.org/) some day, and I'd love to contribute to other fiction podcasts too.

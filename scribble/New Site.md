[simonhildebrandt.com](http://simonhildebrandt.com) badly needs an update, so I'm starting a new project to create something that's reasonably live.

### Basic requirements
 - Markdown content managed through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 
 - Hosting through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 - Deployment via [Github Actions]([https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-firebase-hosting#options](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-firebase-hosting#options))
 - Templated static HTML (for SSO) overlaid with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) based themed view

### Advanced Features
 - RSS
 - Full text search, tag filtering

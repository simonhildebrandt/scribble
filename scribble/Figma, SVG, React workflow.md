During a previous role I explored an approach to create complex animated SVG components in React, based on a designer-maintained Figma source of truth.

Recently I presented this approach at the [React Melbourne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/react-melbourne/events/296479424/). The [video is available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV6JzMUu_vU&t=8830s), and [the project source is available here](https://github.com/simonhildebrandt/svgr-workflow).

It's been a regular frustration to have small bits of data - little mappings, like 'what's the Slack user associated with this Git committer?' sprinkled around with no machine-accessible place to put them. You either don't make the integration you'd like to, or you baked that data in as you write it, so every tool has its own (probably out-of-date) lookup table.

That's why I built [Enumeryx](https://enumeryx.web.app/) - keep your mapping in one place, so it's easy to keep up-to-date.

A light, low power PC like a Raspberry Pi would suit the scale of the project. Future-proofing would be nice too - using the computer for other services like [Plex](http://plex.tv) would be great.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Hardware\n - [DFRobot 10.1\" 800x1280 mini-HDMI IPS Display](http://dfrobot.com/product-2063.html). First casualty of the 'light and simple' ethos was the e-ink display - both affording and driving one started to seem way too difficult. Instead we've got a simple little HDMI display - powered by USB (so it's easily hosted the PC) and very reasonably priced.\n - [Gigabyte BRIX-s](https://www.gigabyte.com/au/Mini-PcBarebone/BRIX-s). Here's where I went a little crazy. Instead of 'the simplest thing that works', I started thinking about the 'future-proofing' angle and Plex, and ended up grabbing one of these (from [PC Case Gear](https://www.pccasegear.com/products/48357/gigabyte-brix-gb-blce-4105r-barebone-kit).)\n \n#### Software\n - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). Had everything I needed - startup items, solid browser, up to date, good support for third party stuff like Plex.\n - [radiator.link](radiator.link). (More about this below.)\n \n#### The build\n\nThe Gigabyte system was very easy to put together - sensibly designed with good instructions. Dropped in a \tKingston A400 2.5in SATA SSD 480GB and some Kingston ValueRAM 8GB (1x8GB) 2400MHz CL17 DDR4 SODIMM (also from PC Case Gear), added a USB hard drive [configured using the Ubuntu bootable drive instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) and it booted perfectly the first time. \n\n#### Configuration\n\nOnce I had Ubuntu up and running (after a little fiddling with my wifi config to disable AP isolation so I could connect to it) it was time to get it configured.\n\n1. SSH access. Super simple - just `apt-get install openssh-server`, and [keep an eye out for the firewall](openssh-server).\n2. Tweak the display. The notes for the monitor apologetically explain that it starts in portrait mode - but actually this was what I wanted. What I quickly realised though is that the cables plug into what is then the 'top' of the display, so I flipped the display in Ubuntu's display settings.\n\nNext I had to think about the actual presentation - what I wanted to display, and how. I wanted a kind of 'kiosk mode' - no OS chrome, no mouse pointer, no login. Simple things first - `apt-get install unclutter` gave me the mouse hiding behaviour I wanted, just by adding `unclutter -idle 1.0 -root` as a startup item; and Ubuntu includes [automatic login](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/user-autologin.html.en) as a preference.\n\nThen, information display. I wanted something configurable, with at least date and time, weather forecast, calendar events. Being a web developer my first thought was to whip something up using those tools, and with a little experimentation I found that Firefox has a built in kiosk mode that I could exploit by creating another startup item like this: `firefox --kiosk https://radiator.link/for/our-cool-radiator`.\n\n#### [Radiator.link](http://radiator.link)\n\nI felt like I was going to be hacking on this for a while, and that it might be useful for others too, so I [grabbed a cheap domain name](https://www.crazydomains.com.au/) (not so cheap after I had to spending twice the cost of the domain for basic TXT record tools, frustratingly) and some handy [Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting).\n\nThe site is my [default barebones web stack](https://github.com/simonhildebrandt/my-webbapp-starter) - [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), plus best-in-class supporting libraries [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). (In the future it'll use Firebase for managing personal details, for customisation.)\n\nThe finished result (plus photobomber.)\n\n![radiator screen with photobomber](assets/radiator-new.jpeg)\n\n#### Update, January 2021\n\n![Updated view](assets/radiator-update.png)\n\nAll configuration moved to Firebase, with unique URLs to access different instances; OpenWeatherMap and Google Calendar integration complete."},{"path":"scribble/TV App.md","content":"---\ncreatedAt: 2021-12-01T00:01:50+00:00\ntags: \n - project\n---\nKeeping track of TV shows can be a hassle - I'd like a simple web app that I can search for tv shows (and movies), track ones I'd like to watch (or are currently), and mark off episodes to keep track of my progress.\n\nPrototype: [tv.requisite.link](http://tv.requisite.link)."},{"path":"scribble/XIAO Notes.md","content":"---\ncreatedAt: 2022-09-11T00:01:50+00:00\ntags:\n - notes\n---\nSpent a few hours wrestling with my new [XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html) (planned brains of my [[Light Tiles|Light Tiles]]) and I should note down all the stuff that tripped me up.\n\n - First I followed the default instructions - but missed the notes about 'two different board definitions' [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/#two-arduino-libraries) . There seems to be some uncertainty about which board I should use, but I saw success using 'Seeed nRF52 mbed-enabled Boards -> Seeed XIAO BLE - nRF52840' for Bluetooth stuff (opposite of those instructions?)\n - It booted as expected the first time, but quickly (once I started trying to use serial commands?) got into a state where I couldn't convince it to accept new sketches (\"No data received on serial port. Not able to proceed.\") After experimentally trying a few tricks (activating the bootloader with a double-tap of the rest button, for example, and booting CircuitPython, [deleting the existing `.uf2` file](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/seeeduino-xiao-dead-unable-to-upload-sketches-after-code-upload-solved/258219)) I noticed that the port I was trying to send to ( `/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port`) had company - just while the bootloader was active - `/dev/cu.usbmodem1101 (Seeed XIAO BLE - nRF52840)`. Switching to that one got me running again. (Of course that required me to reset into bootloader mode again, every time I uploaded a new sketch.)\n - Successfully made it through the bulk of the [BLE usage demo](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-BLE-Sense-Bluetooth-Usage/).\n  - Next stop wifi, BLE from browser, and driving WS2812B Addressable RGB LEDs."}]
